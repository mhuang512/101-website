          <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small, growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded<br>HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized<br>CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

            <h3>Ease Converting<br>Designs into Code</h3>
            <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
